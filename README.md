# spell_checker
A rudimentary spell checking program.

You can use this program by either passing it a file as an argument, or with no arguments and use the stdin stream for input.

**Examples**

Use file as input source

```shell
      ./a.out filename
```


Use stdin as input source, to terminate when finished enter the EOF character (ctrl+d)

```shell
      ./a.out
      A rndom sentnce
      Another random sentcne
      
      rndom
      sentcne
```
